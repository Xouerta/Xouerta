### I am a sophomore majoring in Network Engineering. 
I started dabbling in Python programming in high school (though I wasn't completely fluent at the time). 

In my freshman year, I experimented with various things like C++ (I made a small game with it, but the project was messy so I won't share it), C# (only read books, never really wrote any code), and even tried Unity (although I eventually gave up). 

Now, I'm passionate about developing frontend projects. Initially, I enjoyed creating static web pages using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (looking back, it seems a bit naive). 

However, I stumbled upon Vue during a random encounter, and found it incredibly convenient for frontend development. I'm still learning it now.

(My efficiency is a bit low) I might not even qualify as a proper newbie right now... But it's okay, at least I have confidence in the future, don't I?
